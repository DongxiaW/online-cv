    title: BIOGRAPHY
    summary: |
      I am a PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), 
      advised by Prof. Rose Yu and Prof. Yian Ma. I received my Bachelor degree of science in Applied Math, 
      Physics, and Computer Sciences from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2020. 
      My research primarily lies in Bayesian Deep Learning, especially for spatiotemporal data. My works have been applied 
      to forecasting spatiotemporal systems in epidemiology, traffic and climate science.
